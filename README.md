# OpenGL - Simple House Model

All relevant code is in /PROG54310.Assignment1.SimpleHouse/.

This small C++ application uses OpenGL to create and render a simple model of a house. <br>
The house is constructed within the program, using various transformations applied to primitive triangle and square polygons.
The rainbow filter on the house fades in and out over time, and is applied within the shaders.

The user can also move the camera around freely.
